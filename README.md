# 🔮 Uncertainty Works

Welcome to **Uncertainty Works** — an open-source initiative crafting elegant tools at the bleeding edge of **quantum computing**, **mathematics**, and **chaotic systems**.

## 🌐 Live Demo

> 🔗 [Check out the landing page](https://your-deployed-url.com)  
Built using **TailwindCSS**, **Lottie animations**, and a futuristic glassmorphic design.

---

## 💡 Vision

We embrace uncertainty. From **quantum indeterminacy** to **chaotic attractors**, our goal is to make high-dimensional, complex math *accessible*, *interactive*, and *beautiful* through open-source tools and visual simulations.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- `HTML5 + TailwindCSS` — blazing fast and responsive UI
- `Lottie Animations` — dynamic SVG-based animations
- `Glassmorphism UI` — for a high-end futuristic aesthetic
- `Responsive Layout` — mobile-first design principles

## 🚀 Upcoming Featured Projects

| Project       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🔬 **QuantumJupyter** | A Streamlit-powered visual playground for QML. Drag, drop, simulate quantum circuits. |
| 🌀 **ChaosPy**        | Python toolkit to visualize and explore fractals, Lorenz systems, and chaotic attractors. |
| 🔺 **TopoPy**         | A topological data analysis suite — simplicial complexes, persistent homology & more. |
